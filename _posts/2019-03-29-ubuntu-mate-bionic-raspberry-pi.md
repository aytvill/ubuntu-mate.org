title: Ubuntu MATE 18.04 Beta 1 for Raspberry Pi

---

We are preparing **Ubuntu MATE 18.04 (Bionic Beaver) for the Raspberry Pi**.
With this *Beta* pre-release, you can see what we are trying out in
preparation for our next (stable) version.

![Ubuntu MATE running on the Raspberry Pi 3+](/images/blog/Screenshots/09_raspberrypi.png)

Ubuntu MATE 18.04 Beta 1 is available for Raspberry Pi Model B 2, 3 and 3+,
with separate images for  `armhf` (ARMv7 32-bit) and `arm64` (ARMv8 64-bit).
We have done what we can to optimise the builds for the Raspberry Pi without
sacrificing the full desktop environment Ubuntu MATE provides on PC.
High-level features of these images are:

  * Ubuntu kernel, fully maintained by the Ubuntu Kernel and Security teams.
  * Automatic online filesystem expansion.
  * Ethernet & WiFi (*where available*)
  * Bluetooth (*where available*)
  * Audio out via 3.5mm analog audio jack or HDMI
  * Video out via Composite or HDMI
  * GPIO access via [GPIO Zero](https://gpiozero.readthedocs.io), [pigpio](http://abyz.me.uk/rpi/pigpio/) and [WiringPi](http://wiringpi.com/).
  * Support for [Python Wheels for the Raspberry Pi](https://www.piwheels.org/).
  * Support for [USB Booting](https://www.raspberrypi.org/documentation/hardware/raspberrypi/bootmodes/msd.md).
  * Hardware acceleration:
    * `fbturbo` driver is pre-installed but limited to 2D accelerated window moving/scrolling on Raspberry Pi (using the BCM2835 DMA Controller).
    *  VLC has hardware assisted video decoding.
    *  `ffmpeg` has hardware assisted video decoding and encoding.
    * The *experimental* VC4 driver can be enabled via `raspi-config`.
    * Please note, the `arm64` images do not feature any VideoCore IV hardware acceleration.
  * Additional software:
    * A port of [`raspi-config` for Ubuntu](https://github.com/flexiondotorg/raspi-config/) is pre-installed.
    * [Steam Link](https://support.steampowered.com/kb_article.php?ref=6153-IFGH-6589) is available for install.
    * [Minecraft: Pi Edition](https://projects.raspberrypi.org/en/projects/getting-started-with-minecraft-pi) is available for install.

## Supported Raspberry Pi

  * These images will work on:
    * [Raspberry Pi 2 Model B](https://www.raspberrypi.org/products/raspberry-pi-2-model-b/)
    * [Raspberry Pi 3 Model B](https://www.raspberrypi.org/products/raspberry-pi-3-model-b/)
    * [Raspberry Pi 3 Model B+](https://www.raspberrypi.org/products/raspberry-pi-3-model-b-plus/) **(recommended)**

  * These images *kind of* work on:
    * [Raspberry Pi 3 Model A+](https://www.raspberrypi.org/products/raspberry-pi-3-model-a-plus/) **(not recommended)**
      * Fails to complete the first boot setup due to insufficient memory.
      * If you have completed the setup on another Pi that card can be inserted in a Pi 3 Model A+ and it will work.
      * Due to only having 512MB RAM the `arm64` is not recommended. The `armhf` version can be very tight on resources.

## Unsupported Raspberry Pi

  * These images **will not work on** any Raspberry Pi model using an ARMv6 instruction set:
    * [Raspberry Pi 1 Model A+](https://www.raspberrypi.org/products/raspberry-pi-1-model-a-plus/)
    * [Raspberry Pi 1 Model B+](https://www.raspberrypi.org/products/raspberry-pi-1-model-b-plus/)
    * [Raspberry Pi Zero](https://www.raspberrypi.org/products/raspberry-pi-zero/)
    * [Raspberry Pi Zero W](https://www.raspberrypi.org/products/raspberry-pi-zero-w/)
